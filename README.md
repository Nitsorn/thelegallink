<h1> THE LEGAL LINK </h1>
<h2> Find your local service Professionals </h2>

<p> The legal link is a web-app to search and locate service and legal professionals such as lawyers, doctors, translators, medical specialists etc. around your local neighbourhood. Based in Vancouver, Canada, it serves as a beautiful and easily navigated directory for local residents in need of legal/medical expertise and much more. </p>

<p> I am fully responsible for the design and the development. Built with React.js and Firebase, this was one of my first projects as a developer. </p>
